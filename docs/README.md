## Our Design + Strategy

### First design

### Second design



### Third design

- say something about the open chassis and how it helped us in the end (reducing noise, etc)

## Electrical Components

H-bridges

Encoders

IR Beacon

maybe we can actually draw out the circuits?

motivation for the 4-board circuit

maybe something about how the circuits were basically the same between all robots

## Software

idk write down some buzzwords. or maybe some of the software components that gave us an advantage

our "FFT" class maybe

PID on movements

Pulsing IR

weird shakes and shit like that

unit testing at the end

Dylan says something about state diagrams but tbh I don't feel like that's particularly relevant...
